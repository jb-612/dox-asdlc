## US-05: Workflow Templates

**As a** developer
**I want** to start from pre-built workflow templates instead of building from scratch
**So that** I can quickly create common workflow patterns

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Templates page lists all available templates with name, description, and node count
2. Built-in templates: "11-Step Default aSDLC", "Quick Fix", "Design Review Loop", "TDD Cycle"
3. Clicking a template opens a preview showing the workflow canvas read-only
4. "Use Template" loads the template into the designer as a new workflow
5. "Save as Template" from designer saves current workflow to templates directory
6. Templates show a thumbnail/miniature of the workflow graph
