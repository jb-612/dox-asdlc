# CLI Agent Coordination System

This directory contains runtime files for coordinating multiple Claude CLI instances working on the same codebase.

> **Full documentation:** See `.claude/rules/parallel-coordination.md` for complete rules and workflows.

## Quick Start

```bash
# For backend development
./start-backend.sh

# For frontend development
./start-frontend.sh

# For review/merge operations (orchestrator only)
./start-orchestrator.sh
```

## Files in This Directory

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | This quick reference |
| `status.json` | Instance status tracking (runtime) |
| `reviews/` | Review reports generated by orchestrator |

## Troubleshooting

### "BLOCKED: NO LAUNCHER USED"

Exit Claude Code and restart using `./start-backend.sh`, `./start-frontend.sh`, or `./start-orchestrator.sh`.

### "BLOCKED: FORBIDDEN PATH"

You're trying to modify a file outside your allowed paths. Use the appropriate launcher for your intended work, or request the change via coordination message.

### Git author mismatch warning

The pre-commit hook shows a warning but allows the commit. Restart using the launcher script to set the correct git author.

### Hooks not running

Check that `.claude/settings.json` has the hooks section configured and that the hook scripts in `scripts/hooks/` are executable.

### Identity file not found

Make sure you used a launcher script. The identity file is created at `.claude/instance-identity.json` by the launcher.

## Reverting This System

If the hooks cause issues:

1. Remove the `hooks` section from `.claude/settings.json`
2. Delete `scripts/hooks/` directory
3. Revert `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to the original
4. Run `claude` directly without launchers
