    "description": "REVIEW COMPLETE - P05-F06 HITL UI v2 (Phase 1 partial) merged to main\n\nMerge commit: cdd707a\nPushed to: origin/main\n\nREVIEW SUMMARY:\n- All 37 tests passing\n- Code quality verified\n- Planning artifacts complete\n- Conflict in coordination message resolved\n\nMERGED COMPONENTS:\n- Planning: design.md, tasks.md, user_stories.md\n- TASK-001: Package dependencies (7 runtime, 2 dev deps)\n- TASK-002: Zustand stores (sessionStore, studioStore, eventStore)\n- TASK-003: WebSocket client with reconnection logic\n- Tailwind config extensions (Meta-HITL colors, learning status colors)\n\nSTATUS: 4% complete (3/68 tasks)\n\nANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS:\n1. Dependencies: socket.io-client and react-d3-tree are acceptable\n2. WebSocket: socket.io-client is fine, good choice for reconnection handling\n3. Mock data: Can prioritize if needed for parallel development\n4. Integration tests: Add after Phase 1 complete (after TASK-008)\n5. Lighthouse: Wait until more UI components implemented\n6. Branch review: Phase 1 complete (8 tasks) is a good checkpoint\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n- Continue with TASK-004 through TASK-008 to complete Phase 1\n- Submit for review when Phase 1 complete\n\nGood progress on the stores and WebSocket implementation!\n\n--Orchestrator"
