(2) Does each have design.md, user_stories.md, tasks.md? (3) Were design reviews completed before code was written? (4) Were code reviews completed before commits? (5) Do tests exist for all new code? If ANY step was skipped, warn the user with the specific gap. Skip this check for files under .claude/ and project-level config files (CLAUDE.md, .gitignore, etc.)."
